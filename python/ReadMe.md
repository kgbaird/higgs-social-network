### OBJECTIVE:

  - Python library for Higgs Twitter data to store importable bits

### DEVELOPER NOTES:

  - Currently, tests are not required, but still a good idea. Tests should be written under `pytest` framework
  - It is expected that `PYTHONPATH` will be manipulated to get this library importable (i.e. developers should not munge sys.path themselves)
