### OBJECTIVE:

  - Implementation scripts that process data

### DEVELOPER NOTES:

  - All files contained should be written such that they can be run as scripts
    - Special caveat: Structure of scripts should be that calling `main` functions performs same operations as running as a script
  - It is permissible to group scripts with similar purposes into subdirectories
